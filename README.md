# Deep Learning Paper Implementations
**originally made this back in 2021 for myself currently updating the code for all my papers and publishing them as I get them working**

just a repo of deep learning papers I implemented just to practice implementing and reading/understanding deep learning papers. Every model I train will have a demo you can load up locally to test/try models. this is pretty much my main repo to practicing build ML pipelines from data collection to MLops. 

## machine setup
Here is the machine I used to train all these models
- cpu: threadripper 1920x
- gpu: duel RTX 3090s
- ram: 120 Gbs of DDR4(rgb to make faster)
- os: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS/20.04 LTS
- editor: VScode
